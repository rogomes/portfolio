# Portfolio

Hello there, I am [Rosana de Oliveira Gomes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosanaogomes/), a PhD in Astrophysics and Data scientist trying to change the world one day at a time. I have experience being a Lead Machine Learning Engineer and Project Manager in multiple projects related to social impact such as disaster management, renewable energies, sustainability and mobility. 

In my free time, I love spending time in more relaxing activities, such as [painting by number](https://www.liveabout.com/painting-by-numbers-2578775) or puzzles (part of my creative process).
